The goal of Game Analysis is not to establish how good or bad the game is but to highlight and rationalize the aspects that make the game worth studying and contribute to a better understanding of video games. 
There are different ways to analyze a game. Comparative Analysis involves comparing the game to other forms of game media. It is crucial to clearly define the terms of comparison in this type of data analysis. The other two types of game examination are Reading/Interpretation and Historical Analysis. 

This project focuses on Historical Analysis. Historical Analysis involves analyzing the production history of the game or how it represents a specific milestone in video game history or customer analytics.

The project focuses on Game demographics and players' gaming history. It helps us find patterns and trends.
